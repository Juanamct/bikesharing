# Bike-sharing Program

## Background:
   Create a story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. 
   To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.

## Steps: For this analysis:
    1. Use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. 
    2. Using the converted datatype, youâ€™ll create a set of visualizations to:
        a. Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
        b. Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
        c. Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
     3. Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation: add these new visualizations to the two you created 
        in this module for your final presentation and analysis to pitch to investors.
        
### 1. Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format:
    - Data in the "tripduration" column is converted to a datetime datatype and has the correct time format
    - DataFrame is exported as a new file without the index column

### 2. Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
    - How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
    - How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
    - A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

### 3. Create a Story and Report that describes the key outcomes of the NYC Citibike analysis
    - Results: Using the visualizations you have in your Tableau Story, describe the results of each visualization underneath 
      the image.
    - Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional visualizations that you would perform with the 
      given dataset.
